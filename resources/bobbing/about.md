  "not that there's anything wrong with snobbery"]}
---

if you've been to vancouver, you've probably heard of the snob. at least 3-4 years ago, he _was_ specialty coffee; the scene was able to support a few experimental [holes in the walls](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/chinatown/aubade-coffee-2/) in the middle of nowhere because they had the snob to publicize them. obvs the talent of these baristas is undeniable, but certain products—eg, 10 dollars for a single pour over—are hard to sell without a recommendation or brand power. the coffee snob became that recommendation.

one of the reasons the snob was so successful was its round approach to reviews: everywhere had each coffee drink, the staff, the seating, the food and location, all rated and described, with high gloss pictures and straightforward wording. the web design was standard 2010s wordpress, complete 11 share buttons. it looks and reads like a semiprofessional coffee blogger.

the coffee snob understands that coffee shops aren't just coffee, and coffee isn't just flavour. anyone who loves anything about the coffee shop experience can find the perfect shop for them. all the information is there—but it'll take you hours to sift through it.

this site has two primary goals:
- i want to represent cafe reviews in a way that's quickly parsable: stackable, sortable, filterable. i want somebody who's new to the city to quickly find their perfect cafe.
- i want to pay back all the places that've given me great coffee, to give them the financial security they need to push to greater heights.

## journalistic integrity

i make no claims to objectivity. this is [me](../about-me), my experiences, and my biases, something closer to gonzo journalism. i'm friends with more than a few baristas: i know the depths of their passion, the tales of their struggle. i can't pretend that that doesn't change anything.

that being said, hosting for this site is currently free, so there are no costs to recoup. i will never run ads, and never accept money for anything. i will, however, accept review copies (free drinks), especially if they come from cute boys UωU.
