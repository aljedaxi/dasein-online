    <summary>a bakery that serves surprisingly good turkish coffee</summary>
		<write-up>
			the European bakery is, foremostly, a eastern European bakery. they advertise the Turkish coffee on a small sign above the baked goods in the corner of the cafe. it's absolutely one of the best in downtown, and only about 3 dollars.

			all in all, this is a hidden gem, and the reason i made this website.

		<recc>short-drinks</recc>
		<write-up>
			i don't have—a lot of—insider knowledge. but i pay close attention to some things when i go to cafes, especially when i go to the same cafe almost every day. Monogram was that for me. even [aubade](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/chinatown/aubade-coffee-2/) ran Monogram as their espresso.

			but things have been shifting. many things that i need to write a general "scene think piece" on that don't fit in this article, but also smaller things. the cortados went from being routinely excellent, to sometimes excellent, to always good. staff churn has been increasing. the seasonal drinks have all kinda sucked recently (including the hot chocolate fest hot chocolates).

			Monogram is still better than like, Deville or Analog or Phil and Sebastian, but the margin gets slimmer every year. It's all a bit depressing to think about.

		<reqq>flight</reqq>
		<write-up>
			we might think of T2722 as having three prongs: coffee, tea, and pastry. this is paralleled in the staff, 3 experts: Elle, Julian, and the mysterious french baker who i haven't spoken with. these three work 12 hour shifts, every day. the depths of their passion is a mystery even to me.

			the core idea is pairing these prongs. for each baked good, there's a matching tea or coffee drink. from each pairing emerges—at times—a truly sublime experience. i mean this very specifically and technically. it's like walking through a hallway that opens onto a cliff face, stumbling and flailing as you try not to fall [into a distractingly breath-taking vista](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zya8jdPa-rU). after that first time, every pairing placed before you is a mountain. the sublime seizes.

			T2722 started as a pop-up for hot chocolate fest in the Weslian hotel. they were easily the best hot chocolate that year, and have continued to levitate above the competition thence. for 2 years they've been doing pop-ups for some of the worlds biggest brands, and hosting tastings for some of the city's richest people. all ingredients are of a highest quality you can find in this city. it's definitely the priciest cafe on this list, but you can only get comparable quality in Tokyo or Paris for twice the price.

				<summary>a principled, french approach to specialty</summary>
				<write-up>
					a facet is a window; the facet holds the gem up, and pours light into it, and sucks light out of it.

					to mill or grind coffee is not to facet it. coffee as such is not coffee itself. coffee is this other thing. when i talk about coffee, there's the taste, the aroma, the sight, the feel of the heat in your hands. there's the atmosphere, the thought you spare to the people you bring with you.

					there's the mouth feel, the heaviness, the comfort of coffee. as Paul Zits wrote, "day break[s]//under the coffee pot". T2722 captures this in a way i haven't felt since [aubade](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/chinatown/aubade-coffee-2/). it may not—it certainly doesn't—do high clarity the way other top tier coffeehouses do, but they do something special; something at the top of that game.

					please note that the variety is massive and constantly shifting, so i can't walk you through the experience of drinking what's currently on. just know that, with a bit of a conversation, you'll be able to find exactly what you want.

					i've had a lot of very good coffee. when i had the coffee here, it didn't blow my mind[1]. the food was genuinely life changing. i'm not certain why i've focused exclusively on beverages; why i've never sought out solid food this good before. i now feel this folly.

					i can't capture the actual experience, nor the techniques nor ingredients. i asked Julien how to categorize the dishes and he hasn't come up with the words yet, so i don't feel too bad.

					tldr; get in before they raise the price.

					[1] tbh, i'd never had a _really_ good medium-dark roast, so it did open my mind in that regard.

			absolutely the best views in the city. if you can sneak in with a thermos of coffee from elsewhere, you've got the best of both worlds. inside, it feels like the decor was decided by an up and coming oil-sands failson with lots of capital and little taste.

			MobSquad cafe doubles as someone to marry to get a green card.

					the views are nice. i can see telus sky; the top of the bay building; the building Major Toms' is in; the head; &amp;c. i can see the trains and the people come and go, the cars stop and start and idle.

					inside is supposed to be some sort of co-working space, so there's plenty of seating. i've never seen this place more than 25% full. outlets are plentiful.

					as for the "vibe" proper: absolute airspace. a charmless corporate appropriation of third wave. it [transubstantiates](https://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com/2022/01/a-horizontal-aspect-to.html) the fairly standard [sirius xm coffee house](https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/the-coffee-house) bops into [pure bathos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathos).

					truly an edifying experience.

			i've got a feeling that i didn't get the full Q Lab experience. sure, i got the flight, and i was walked through the options, and i chose cool options and spoke with the barista. somewhere along the line, i got the feeling i missed something essential. when most coffee houses put the word "coffee" on the menu, they mean only the "coffee liqueur", the liquid byproduct of the coffee brewing process. when Q Labs uses the word coffee, they mean liquid, roasted beans, green coffee, &amp;c.

			There's something very special here that's easily missed.

				<summary>closer to cupping</summary>
				<write-up>
					this is what's convinced me i need an internal ranking system among 2s. this is the strongest 2 on the site. the coffee is good. the coffee is great.

					it just isn't in the same league as Sought and Found, Paradigm Spark, T2722, &amp;c., because the place is more about green than they are about brown. it's closer to cupping in the sense that this is a pure exploration of terroir and processing technique, to the exclusion of brewing technique.

					again, not bad. better than ever other two. it's just focused on something else.

					the first thing you're struck with on your way in is that you're not struck by any single thing. there's a lot going on, especially when you first enter. there's wall of windows—the torrent of cold light—leading to the wall of bean bags, leading to a wall of equipment, leading to an espresso machine??? a deeply mysterious espresso machine on a table, leading to the cash register.

					as it stands—which may end soon—the storefront oscillates between spartan and cluttered. it feels like a _lab_; a place where people work on and with coffee. it's neat. i wouldn't be surprised if this feeling was just part of the opening process, but i would be depressed.

			what truly pulls this place together is the exposed brick. the chairs are draped in marathon numbers; half the wall decor is skis, the other half is pictures of mountains and drawings of skiiers; the coat rack and the divider between the seating and brewing are both made of reclaimed skis. it's being among unfinished wood beams and the raw concrete floor that reveals these materials as honest, functional, and stylish
