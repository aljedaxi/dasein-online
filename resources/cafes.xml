    <summary>a bakery that serves surprisingly good turkish coffee</summary>
		<write-up>
			the European bakery is, foremostly, a eastern European bakery. they advertise the Turkish coffee on a small sign above the baked goods in the corner of the cafe. it's absolutely one of the best in downtown, and only about 3 dollars.

			all in all, this is a hidden gem, and the reason i made this website.

					the baked goods run the gamut from flat breads, northern european loaves, baguettes, and pretzels, to savory stuffed goods like [bureks](https://www.thespruceeats.com/traditional-yugoslavian-rolled-burek-borek-recipe-1805900). on the right side of the store are imports from all around Europe. everything is excellent and very reasonably priced.

			i think Paradigm Spark is the best coffee in the city right now. They just took home 4th place at Canada's brewer's cup, so it's not hard to make the argument.

						there's no better coffee bar in the city. the floor is very [open](https://youtu.be/UoCrx0scCkM?si=0sP5bYAHr2bWwvvr&amp;t=1336), with all the equipment and technique thusly scrutable.

						what you really need to do is talk. everyone is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. ask about why all the coffee is pre-ground, why they only use the hario switch, why the bags of coffee are all different colours—anything that catches your eye. everything was chosen for a reason.

    <summary>genuinely world class. consider yourself fortunate we have access to this</summary>
		<write-up>
			we might think of T2722 as having three prongs: coffee, tea, and pastry. this is paralleled in the staff, 3 experts: Elle, Julian, and the mysterious french baker who i haven't spoken with. these three work 12 hour shifts, every day. the depths of their passion is a mystery even to me.

			the core idea is pairing these prongs. for each baked good, there's a matching tea or coffee drink. from each pairing emerges—at times—a truly sublime experience. i mean this very specifically and technically. it's like walking through a hallway that opens onto a cliff face, stumbling and flailing as you try not to fall [into a distractingly breath-taking vista](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zya8jdPa-rU). after that first time, every pairing placed before you is a mountain. the sublime seizes.

			T2722 started as a pop-up for hot chocolate fest in the Weslian hotel. they were easily the best hot chocolate that year, and have continued to levitate above the competition thence. for 2 years they've been doing pop-ups for some of the worlds biggest brands, and hosting tastings for some of the city's richest people. all ingredients are of a highest quality you can find in this city. it's definitely the priciest cafe on this list, but you can only get comparable quality in Tokyo or Paris for twice the price.

				<summary>a principled, french approach to specialty</summary>
				<write-up>
					a facet is a window; the facet holds the gem up, and pours light into it, and sucks light out of it.

					to mill or grind coffee is not to facet it. coffee as such is not coffee itself. coffee is this other thing. when i talk about coffee, there's the taste, the aroma, the sight, the feel of the heat in your hands. there's the atmosphere, the thought you spare to the people you bring with you.

					there's the mouth feel, the heaviness, the comfort of coffee. as Paul Zits wrote, "day break[s]//under the coffee pot". T2722 captures this in a way i haven't felt since [aubade](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/chinatown/aubade-coffee-2/). it may not—it certainly doesn't—do high clarity the way other top tier coffeehouses do, but they do something special; something at the top of that game.

					please note that the variety is massive and constantly shifting, so i can't walk you through the experience of drinking what's currently on. just know that, with a bit of a conversation, you'll be able to find exactly what you want.

				<write-up>
					i've had a lot of very good coffee. when i had the coffee here, it didn't blow my mind[1]. the food was genuinely life changing. i'm not certain why i've focused exclusively on beverages; why i've never sought out solid food this good before. i now feel this folly.

					i can't capture the actual experience, nor the techniques nor ingredients. i asked Julien how to categorize the dishes and he hasn't come up with the words yet, so i don't feel too bad.

					tldr; get in before they raise the price.

					[1] tbh, i'd never had a _really_ good medium-dark roast, so it did open my mind in that regard.

			absolutely the best views in the city. if you can sneak in with a thermos of coffee from elsewhere, you've got the best of both worlds. inside, it feels like the decor was decided by an up and coming oil-sands failson with lots of capital and little taste.
