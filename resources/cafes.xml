    <summary>a bakery that serves surprisingly good turkish coffee</summary>
		<write-up>
			the European bakery is, foremostly, a eastern European bakery. they advertise the Turkish coffee on a small sign above the baked goods in the corner of the cafe. it's absolutely one of the best in downtown, and only about 3 dollars.

			the baked goods run the gamut from flat breads, northern european loaves, baguettes, and pretzels, to savory stuffed goods like [bureks](https://www.thespruceeats.com/traditional-yugoslavian-rolled-burek-borek-recipe-1805900). on the right side of the store are imports from all around Europe. everything is excellent and very reasonably priced.

			all in all, this is a hidden gem, and the reason i made this website.

		<summary>excellent views</summary>
		<write-up>
			absolutely the best views in the city. if you can sneak in with a thermos of coffee from elsewhere, you've got the best of both worlds. inside, it feels like the decor was decided by an up and coming oil-sands failson with lots of capital and little taste.
