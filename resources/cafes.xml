    <summary>a bakery that serves surprisingly good turkish coffee</summary>
		<write-up>
			the European bakery is, foremostly, a eastern European bakery. they advertise the Turkish coffee on a small sign above the baked goods in the corner of the cafe. it's absolutely one of the best in downtown, and only about 3 dollars.

			all in all, this is a hidden gem, and the reason i made this website.

					the baked goods run the gamut from flat breads, northern european loaves, baguettes, and pretzels, to savory stuffed goods like [bureks](https://www.thespruceeats.com/traditional-yugoslavian-rolled-burek-borek-recipe-1805900). on the right side of the store are imports from all around Europe. everything is excellent and very reasonably priced.

    <summary>genuinely world class. consider yourself fortunate we have access to this</summary>
		<write-up>
			we might think of T2722 as having three prongs: coffee, tea, and pastry. this is paralleled in the staff, 3 experts: Elle, Julian, and the mysterious french baker who i haven't spoken with. these three work 12 hour shifts, every day. the depths of their passion is a mystery even to me.

			the core idea is pairing these prongs. for each baked good, there's a matching tea or coffee drink. from each pairing emerges—at times—a truly sublime experience. i mean this very specifically and technically. it's—to one who hasn't had the experience before—rather like finding yourself suddenly on the edge of a mountain, staring down at [a vista you didn't know existed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zya8jdPa-rU). after that first time, every pairing placed before you is a mountain. the sublime seizes.

			T2722 started as a pop-up for hot chocolate fest in the Weslian hotel. they were easily the best hot chocolate that year, and have continued to levitate above the competition thence. for 2 years they've been doing pop-ups for some of the worlds biggest brands, and hosting tastings for some of the city's richest people. all ingredients are of a highest quality you can find in this city. it's definitely the priciest cafe on this list, but you can only get comparable quality in Tokyo or Paris for twice the price.

				<summary>a principled, french approach to specialty</summary>
				<write-up>
					a facet is a window; the facet holds the gem up, and pours light into it, and sucks light out of it.

					to mill or grind coffee is not to facet it. coffee as such is not coffee itself. coffee is this other thing. when i talk about coffee, there's the taste, the aroma, the sight, feel of it in your hands. there's the atmosphere, the thought you spare to the people you bring with you.

					there's the mouth feel, the heaviness, the comfort of coffee. as Paul Zits wrote, "day break[s]//under the coffee pot". T2722 captures this in a way i haven't felt since [aubade](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/chinatown/aubade-coffee-2/). it may not—it certainly doesn't—do high clarity the way that the other top tier coffeehouses on this list do, but they do something different, something special, and something at the top of that game.

					please note that the variety is massive and constantly shifting, so i can't walk you through the experience of drinking what's currently on. just know that, with a bit of a conversation, you'll be able to find exactly what you want.

					<write-up>on the other hand, i had something of a similar quality at [glitch](https://tokyocoffee.org/2016/04/15/glitch-coffee-roasters/) in Tokyo—admittedly in ochanomizu—for 4 times the price? so, again, reasonable.</write-up>

			absolutely the best views in the city. if you can sneak in with a thermos of coffee from elsewhere, you've got the best of both worlds. inside, it feels like the decor was decided by an up and coming oil-sands failson with lots of capital and little taste.
